# WGUPS-Routing-Program
This is my final project for Data Structures and Algorithms II â€“ C950 at Western Governors University.

## Project Premise
For this assessment, you will apply the algorithms and data structures you studied in this course to solve a real programming problem. You will implement an algorithm to route delivery trucks that will allow you to meet all delivery deadlines while traveling the least number of miles. You will also describe and justify the decisions you made while creating this program.

The skills you showcase in your completed project may be useful in responding to technical interview questions for future employment. This project may also be added to your portfolio to show to future employers.

## Overview of class:
Data Structures and Algorithms II explores the analysis and implementation of high-performance data structures and supporting algorithms, including graphs, hashing, self-adjusting data structures, set representations, and dynamic programming. The course also introduces students to NP-complete problems. The course discusses how to use Python techniques to implement software solutions for problems of memory management and data compression. This course has two prerequisites: Data Structures and Algorithms I and Discrete Math II.

## Competencies:
* Non-Linear Data Structures
* Hashing Algorithms and Structures
* Dictionaries and Sets
* Self-Adjusting Data Structures
* Self-Adjusting Heuristics
* NP-Completeness and Turing Machines
